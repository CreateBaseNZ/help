## Register

Registering your school starts by completing the registration form on the My Groups page.

Each form is individually verified by our team to authenticate genuine schools on our Platform. Once a form is submitted, our team will get in touch via email within 24 hours to notify you of your school's registration. Upon confirmation, your school group will be formed and you will automatically become the [admin user](https://help.createbase.co.nz/managing-groups-&-classes/school-group-roles).

During this time, please feel free to learn more about our platform from the Support tab or complete our Platform Onboarding. You can also experience the non-teaching aspects of Projects from the Browse tab.

## Join

### Joining as a teacher

If your school has already been registered, you can simply join it by navigating to the [My Groups](https://app.createbase.co.nz/my-groups) page and clicking the `Join` button.

You may attach a message with your join request, which will be seen by the admin (the user who registered your school) processing your request.
