Each groups has its own set of roles. For schools, there are three types:

- **Admin** — the admin role has access to the entire group. They are responsible for managing teachers and students. For example, this includes approving teacher's join requests and updating billing information for the group.

- **Teacher** — the teacher role has access to most of the platform. Teachers are mainly responsible for teaching and managing their classes.

- **Student** — the student role has the most restricted access. They can only use the learning content of Projects.

Each student in a class needs their own account to access the platform for tracking, management, and administrative purposes.
