To use the CreateBase platform you need to be part of a group. From the "My Account" tab, you can view all the groups your account has joined. A single CreateBase account can belong to multiple groups. ~~yeap~~

Groups can either be a learning institution (school/other) or a family (coming soon). School groups are managed by [admin accounts](/managing-groups-&-classes/school-group-roles) and must contain all of the teachers and students in your school who wish to use the platform.

If you’re a **teacher**, learn how to register or join a school group [here](/managing-groups-&-classes/register-or-join-your-school) and how to add students to your group [here](/managing-groups-&-classes/adding-students).

If you’re a **student**, learn how to join a school group [here](/managing-groups-&-classes/register-or-join-your-school).
