To use the [Manage Users](https://app.createbase.co.nz/manage-users) tab, please note that you need to be an admin or a teacher in a group. Read more about the different school group roles [here](https://help.createbase.co.nz/managing-groups-&-classes/school-group-roles).

In the Manage Users tab, you can view all the accounts that have joined your group.

Users are grouped based on their role within the group: admin, teacher or student.
